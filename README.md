Pig game is a multiplayer dice roll game, whoever reaches the score greater than 20 will be considered as winner by rolling dice which will be there on screen. 
There are few rules : 
1. Each player will roll a dice multiple times, until he/she gets dice value as '1'. Once the value is '1' score of that player will get reset.
2. There is a option called 'Hold' which can be used at any time. So that next dice roll chance will be passed to opposite player and current score will get added to total score.
